# Zero-Sum-Game
This contains the implementation of the algorithm used to solve a two-person zero-sum game based on game theory. Then, it applies the algorithm to find the best strategy for both player 1 and player 2 to play a simple card game. The payoff matrix is generated by random, but can be interpret as the "overall power over player 2" or "advantage gain" for player 1.
